# Boggle-Practice-Code-
 
While this game technically functions like boggle, it has these current limitations.

1 - There are no repeated letters on the board.

2 - You can type any string of letters. I am working on learning how to link it to an english word dictionary :)

3 - You can reuse the same letter in the same word.

These will be touched on over time. I am looking forward to solving these issues.
